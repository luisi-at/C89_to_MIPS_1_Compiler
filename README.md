# C89_to_MIPS_I_Compiler_2017
An individual Computer Architecture coursework project to construct a full compiler using Flex and Bison.
Compiles C89 specification code to the MIPS I ISA.

## Functional Components

  * Arithmetic and Logic Expressions, including rudimentary constant folding
  * If, If-Else and Switch
  * For and While Looping
  * Void function calls
  * Global Variables, implementing precidence with local variables
 
### A Note:
The repo has been left in a 'working state' but with all final changes merged into Master. Just to reflect the evolution of the code and the development process, thought it was a nice thing to do.
